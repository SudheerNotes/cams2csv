I’ve built this tool for my own personal use so lot of love and passion involved.  It's a fully Open Source project and comes with GPL3 License. I have no intention of collecting your data, **I respect your privacy as much as mine**.

No malicious code what’s so ever, the code is hosted on GitHub so you can review yourself.    

At this stage, I’m supporting both Windows & Linux (Ubuntu) platforms and the packages can be downloaded from the below links.
